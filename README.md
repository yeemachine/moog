Robert Moog's Theremin
=================

Robert Moog was an extremely influential electronic music toolmaker in the 60's and 70's. His Moog Synthesizer and its subsequent successors greatly democritized the ability to create and manipulate digital sounds for musicians globally. 

This is a doodle celebrating Robert Moog's work by exploring the instrument that inspired his career, the Theremin.
While the synthesizer is definitely his most well known work, Moog began his career selling Theremin kits, one of the earliest electronics instruments invented by LÃ©on Theremin. Respecting its nuanced construction, he would continue building Theremins until his passing.
